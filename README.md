# MouseLogger
C++ program that follows your mouse movements

The code captures your mouse pointer movements and stores them into an array called 'points' .locations stored in 'points' can be used for taking control of the mouse cursor .
Here I have showed how you can use this code to store the cursor postion while darwing in paint and then using it again to redraw what you had drawn.

By changing the accuracy you can determine how many locations will be stored if you use the accuracy 1(less is better accuracy) then 1000 points will be stored in the array.
if you increase the 'acc' less points will be stored and as the result there will be lower accuracy in following the cursor.
